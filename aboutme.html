                One of my hobbies during my freetime is drawing. I like creating characters from the top of my head and giving them their own personality, characteristics, looks, etc. I am interested in pursuing animation because it is fascinating to me how a drawing, thought, scene can be brought to life through animation. 
                Animation is also a reason why I prefer watching animated films or shows than realistic ones. Hopefully in the future I can get an internship at Pixar !

                I also like watching movies and anime every now and then. I'm not one to watch tv series because I tend to lose interest in them very quickly unless they're cartoons. My favorite kind of movies are mainly animated films like Wall-E, UP, and The Iron Giant. My current favorite anime is: Mob Psycho 100, My Hero Academia,
                and The Promised Neverland.
